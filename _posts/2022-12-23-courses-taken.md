## Courses that I have taken or am taking since university with a one-sentence summary
#### updated Dec. 2022. Default: course taken @ HKU. Not in chromatic order, but in the order of increasing course index number. 


### CS Courses

#### ENGG1330 Computer Programming I
2021 Fall; Dr. Schnieders Dirk, Dr. Chui CK

Basic contents: Python Programming

Acceptable course. A Python intro course. Nothing to talk about. (I also personally did take the role of Student Teaching Assistant in 2022 Fall. I think basically the lecture contents are not "difficult" enough to cover the exam, which is kind of the common at HKU. On the other hand, CS is about self-learning. )


#### ENGG1340 Computer Programming II
2022 Spring; Dr. Luo Ruibang, Dr. Qian Chenxiong

Basic contents: Linux shell, Git, C/C++ (recursion, dynamic memory management, STL)

Good course. A self-taught course on programming techniques. The contents are well-prepared so the self-learning experience is good. There is also a console game project. 


#### COMP2119 Intro to data structures and algorithms
2022 Fall; Dr. Hubert Chan

Basic contents: basic data structures and algorithms (stack, queue, tree, hashing, searching, sorting, etc.)

Acceptable course. I always complain that CS courses at HKU do not have a separate tutorial session - they take the time of the lecture. Therefore, sometimes the instructor is left with insufficient time. 


#### COMP2121 Discrete Math
2022 Fall; Dr. Hubert Chan

Basic contents: basic data structures and algorithms (stack, queue, tree, hashing, searching, sorting, etc.)

Acceptable course, it takes time to do the assignments, especially the graph theory part. In fact Dr. Hubert is quite nice (you can always discuss questions with him. It's just that the exam questions are too difficult.)


#### ELEC2441 Computer Organization
2021 Fall; Dr. Vincent Tam

Basic contents: Computer organization, CPU, ARM assembly

Good course. Dr. Tam is really nice. 


#### COMP3366 Quantum Algorithms
2022 Fall; Dr. Yuxiang Yang

Basic contents: Quantum computing foundations; Quantum algorithms; Quantum computation implementation; NISQ algorithms

Outstanding course. Just take it if you are confident with your math / linear algrbra. 


#### (PU) SML201 Introduction to Data Science; =COMP2501
2023 Spring


#### (PU) COS324 Introduction to Machine Learning; =COMP3314
2023 Spring


#### (PU) COS333 Advanced Programming Techniques; =COMP3297
2023 Spring


# Math Courses

#### MATH1851 Calculus and ODE
2022 Spring; Dr. Zhang Xin; Prof. Chow Kwok Wing

Basic contents: Calculus and ODE

Part 1: acceptable; part 2: good. Typical Engineering course. Less rigorous and comprehensive than courses taught by Math department 


#### MATH1853 Linear Algebra and Probability & Statistics
2021 Fall; Dr. Wong Ngai; Prof. Han Guangyue

Basic contents: Linear Algebra and Probability & Statistics

Acceptable course which introduces linear algebra and P&S. 


#### MATH2014 Multivariable Calculus and Linear Algebra
2022 Fall; Dr. Zhang Haiyu

Basic contents: Multivariable Calculus and Linear Algebra

Acceptable course. Another math course for non-Math students. Because of the limited lecture hours, the course is not comprehensive enough. But if you are willing to read textbooks yourself to learn the remaining topics not covered by the course, it can be regarded as a course to substitute MATH2101 and MATH2211. 


#### STAT2601 Probability & Statistics I
2022 Fall; Dr. Wat K.P.

Basic contents: Probability theory

Outstanding course. Take it if you have a relatively not intensive semester. Not necessarily need to be good at math. 


#### (PU) ORF245 Fundamentals of Statistics; =STAT2601
2023 Spring


#### (PU) ORF309 Probability and Stochastic Systems; =STAT3603
2023 Spring


# EE Courses

#### ELEC2346 Electric Circuit Theory
2021 Fall; Dr. Albert Lee

Basic contents: Electric Circuit Theory

Good course. Easy to get good grade, good explanation from the instructor. Sidetalk: I don't know the reason why the lab session exists. 


#### ENGG1310 Introduction to EE
2022 Spring; Dr. Choi Hoi Wai, Hou Yunhe, Qi Xiaojuan

Basic contents: 

Unacceptable course. Never fully understood a lecture since part 2. Horrible exam questions. I have no idea why semiconductor is taught in an EE intro course in a way that no one can understand. If all courses were of this quality, then I must have transferred to another university. 


# Other Courses

#### ENGG1300 Fundamental Mechanics
2021 Fall; Dr. Law Kwan Ho, Su Kai Leung, Szeto Wai Yuen, Xu Lizhi, Ye Hailong

Basic contents: Fundamental Mechanics. Static & non-static systems; analysis, etc. 

Good course with well-organized contents. 


#### ENGG1320 Engineers in Modern World
2022 Spring; 

Basic contents: I don't remember; a project

Terrible course. Nothing learned. I wish I have told me to take an equivalent course during the exchange. 


#### CCST9017 Hidden Order in Daily Life: A Mathematical Perspective
2021 Fall; Dr. Hua Zheng, Ng Tuen Wai, Zhang Zhiwen

Basic contents: Interesting applications of math. Virus model, Nash equilibrium, AI/ML, etc. 

Good course. 


#### CCHU9056 Virtual World, Real Bodies
2022 Spring; Dr. Ng Kal Ka Lung

Basic contents: VR and humanity

Terrible course. After taking this course, I decided not to take any Common Core course at HKU anymore. 


#### (PKU Summer) China modern economy; =CCHU9007
2022 Summer

Basic contents: China's modern economy

Good course. Insteresting contents and nice grading. Wonderful substitute for CCCH9007 to fulfill CC requirements by HKU. 


#### (PKU Summer) Sustainability theories and practives; =CCGL9040
2022 Summer

Basic contents: Sustainability theories and practives

Unacceptable course. I cannot recall anything I learned now (I am writing this doc in Dec. 2022, and I took this course just in August.) Anyway, it can help me escape the horrifying CC requirements, so I took it. 


# Audited / Non-credit MOOCs / Others

#### Algorithms, Part I & II (PU COS226)
2022 Winter

Basic contents: Data structures and algorithms (in Java)

A bit more in-depth than COMP2119 at HKU. I think this contains also some topics in COMP3250. 


#### MAT1A10 Mathematical Analysis I (Maki Lab)
2022 Winter
